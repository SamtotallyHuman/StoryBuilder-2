# About StoryBuilder

Our mission is to provide a free open-source resource for writers of all levels who struggle with the complexity of plotted fiction.

StoryBuilder is an editor for fiction outlines from which writers can quickly create working drafts. It uses best-practice techniques and offers hundreds of suggestions for better stories. It's CAD for fiction writers.

The elements StoryBuilder works with are the elements of good fiction: realistic three 
dimensional characters who are engaged in meaningful and gripping problems, dramatic 
and suspenseful plots, and settings that appeal to the senses.

## Built With

* [WinUI 3][1]
* [Windows App SDK][2]
* [Windows Community Toolkit][3]
* [elmah.io][4]
* [NRtfTree][5]
* [Scrivener][6]
* [SyncFusion][7]

WinUI has announced plans to make its code available as open source.

Windows Community Toolkit is available under the [MIT License][14].

elmah.io is a commercial cloud-based error logging and uptime monitor service. elmah.io graciously provides a [free subscription][15] to public repository open source projects. We are grateful for their support.

NRtfTree is available under the [GNU GPL V3 License][16]. StoryBuilder has changed this software locally to allow
asynchronous IO.

[Scrivener][6] is a commercial writing application widely used by novelists, screenwriters, playwrights, and short fiction writers. 
StoryBuilder contains a feature that inserts StoryBuilder reports into a Scrivener project using their Scrivener 3 File Formatting Specification API. 

[Syncfusion WinUI Controls][7] is a commercial toolkit of controls for WinUI 3 projects. StoryBuilder uses their 
ComboBox control extensively. Syncfusion graciously provides an [Open Source Project License][17]. We are grateful 
for their support.   


## Getting Started

StoryBuilder is a duck with its feet in two ponds: the user community of writers and the community of developers. 

### For writers

If you are (or want to be) a fiction writer, welcome! StoryBuilder is for you. An introduction to StoryBuilder 
for users is the [User Documentation][9].

You're welcome to try the software for yourself (it's free.) StoryBuilder is currently in beta test. If you're interested 
in becoming a beta tester, please email support@storybuilder.org and ask for a copy of the software.

you can find complete documentation in the [User Manual][8], which also serves as online help for the program.

### For Developers

If you're a developer, welcome! A good starting place is to learn what StoryBuilder is about, using the 
same [User Documentation][9].

Strictly from the code side, take a look at [Programmer Notes][10].

## Usage

We will provide a program demo video soon.

We group StoryBuilder's plans into a series of [GitHub Projects][18].

Currently, we're completing the [Distribute StoryBuilder via WIndows Store][19] project.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/storybuilder-org/StoryBuilder-2/issues) for a complete list of proposed 
features and known bugs.

## Acknowledgements

We are grateful beyond words for those who have helped bring StoryBuilder back to life as free and open-source software. Some have contributed time, others have contributed ideas, and others have inspired the project.
We are most grateful for all of them- especially those who toil in the arena:
